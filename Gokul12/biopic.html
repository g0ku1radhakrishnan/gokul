<p class="para"><b>Edgar Allan Poe: </b>Best known for his poems and short <br>
    fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, born in Boston, Jan 19, 1809, <br>
    died Oct. 7, 1849 in Baltimore, deserves more credit than <br>
    any other writer for the transformation of the short story <br>
    from anecdote to art. He virtually created the detective <br>
    story and perfected the psychological thriller. He also <br>
    produced some of the most influential literary criticism of <br>
    his time-important theoretical statements on poetry and the short story- <br>
    -and has had a worldwide influence on literature. <br></p>
    <p class="para">
    He was born as Edgar Poe in Boston, Massachusetts; his parents died <br>
    when he was young. Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of <br>
    Richmond, Virginia, but they never formally adopted him. After spending a <br>
    short period at the University of Virginia and briefly attempting a military <br>
    career, Poe parted ways with the Allans. Poe's publishing career began <br>
    humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems. Tamerlane and Other <br>
    Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian" <br></p>
